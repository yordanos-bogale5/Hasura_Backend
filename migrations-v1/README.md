# FAQ

## What does this migration script do?

1. Drop all Hasura relationships specific for HBPv1.
2. Crete new tables specific for HBPv2 and copy relevant data from old to the new tables.

## Will this script always work?

Almost. The script will work in most cases, even if you have made custom columns and relationships on the user's table.

The script will probably not work if you have made custom columns and relationships on other auth specific tables such as `roles`, `user_roles`, `auth.refresh_tokens` etc. But you most likely didn't do that.
